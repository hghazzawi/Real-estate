    <span lang="EN-CA">
      We collect information in two ways:
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      1) When you give it to us or give us
      permission to obtain it.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      When you sign up for or use our products,
      you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name,
      profile photo, comments and any other information you provide us.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
	<br/>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      2) We get technical information when you
      use our products.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      Whenever you use a website, mobile
      application, or other internet service, there is certain information that
      almost always created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use
      our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this
      way:
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      Log Data: When you use Listed.com, our
      servers automatically record information about your interaction with our
      products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends
      whenever you visit Listed.com. This log data may include your Internet Protocol
      address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to
      Listed.com, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how
      you used Listed.com.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      When you are accessing Listed.com, we may use
      "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you
      visit our website, unique to your Listed.com account or your browser), or similar
      technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use
      "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or
      "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete
      them).
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      Device Information: In addition to log
      data, we may also collect information about the device you're using while
      browsing Listed.com, including what type of device it is, what operating system
      you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.
      Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type
      of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of
      information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or
      an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device
      makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device
      manufacturer or software provider.

      How do we use the information we collect?

  </h1>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      We use the information we collect to
      provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and
      protect Listed.com and our users. For example, we may log how often people use
      two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version
      is better.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      We also use the information we collect to
      send you updates, newsletters, marketing materials and other information that
      may be of interest to you.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      The information we collect may be
      "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically
      identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable"
      (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of
      information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or
      store information wherever we do business, including countries outside your
      own.

  <p>
    <span lang="EN-CA">
      When we have your consent. This includes
      sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you've
